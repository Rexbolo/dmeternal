HOW TO PLAY
===========

There's not much to play at the moment, but you can do a bit...

Run chargen.py to make some characters. From the command line type:

  python chargen.py

Or maybe just double click chargen.py, which should work. Or right click and
select "Open with Python". You'll find a way.

After that, you can load up to four characters in campaign.py:

  python campaign.py

You will find your party on a mostly empty map. There are some shopkeepers to
talk to, but alas the shops don't function yet. There's a building and a river,
neither of which do anything. There are also two piles of items on the ground
in front of the building's door. Stand on a pile, then click again with the
mouse to pick them up.

Go to the other side of the river and you will find some monsters to fight.

COMMANDS
========

Left click: Move to spot/Pick up items

Right click: Open popup menu

1-4: View party member/inventory screen

c: Center the screen on the party/active character

Q: Quit the game. There is no saving because there is no point.
