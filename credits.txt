Most tiles by the supremely talented (and generous) David Gervais. You can
download his tilesets from here:

Part of the graphic tiles used in this program is the public domain roguelike
tileset "RLTiles". Some of the tiles have been modified by me.

    You can find the original tileset at:

Many other graphics obtained from http://opengameart.org

Nuclear explosion, Pearl effect by Jetrel.


Programming mostly by Joseph Hewitt, except the bits I stole from other people.
